# TextFormatter
 Hi everyone! Here's MrFreex, I started recently to develope some windows forms app to learn some c# , anyway this software allows you to specify some text in wich you'll be able to add some specified words
 example:
 
 "This is a %1 text using %2 by mrfreex" words list: 
 
 "Formatted
  TextFormatter
 "
 
 this will output "This is a Formatted text using TextFormatter by mrfreex"
 the UI looks like this:
